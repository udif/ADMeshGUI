ADMeshGUI
=========

STL viewer and manipulation tool.

Manipulation and repair algorithms come from [ADMesh](https://github.com/admesh/admesh) library and [stlsplit](https://github.com/hroncok/stlsplit) library is used for splitting.

Building
--------

In order to run ADMeshGUI, [ADMesh library](https://github.com/admesh/admesh), [stlsplit library](https://github.com/hroncok/stlsplit), [Qt 5.4](http://www.qt.io/download/) (or higher) with qmake, OpenGL, [StlCut](http://github.com/Nathaniell1/STL_CUT) and g++ are necessary.

On **Linux**, unzip downloaded package, navigate to target directory and type following into terminal:

    qmake # or qmake-qt5 on some distros
    make
    sudo make install
    
On **Mac OS X** use [homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew). You can install ADMeshGUI directly from our homebrew tap by typing following into terminal:

    brew tap admesh/admesh
    brew install admeshgui --HEAD
    brew linkapps admeshgui

or if you prefer to build it manually, type following into terminal (installs all required dependencies):

    brew tap admesh/admesh
    brew install gettext qt5 admesh stlsplit
    /usr/local/opt/qt5/bin/qmake 
    make	

On **Windows** download [admeshgui-win.zip](https://github.com/vyvledav/ADMeshGUI/releases) containing precompiled application.

If you intend to build ADMeshGUI on Windows by yourself, the process is not that straightforward though. You must make sure Qt5 and all other dependendencies (admesh, stlsplit, gettext) are properly installed and paths set, so it is possible to link them. Then run *qmake* and *make* in terminal.

It is also possible to build ADMeshGUI in Qt Creator which comes with Qt package.
